Ganesh Chaturthi is an 11 day celebration, culminating when villages transport their Ganesh to a lake and immerse it, watching it dissolve. As Ganesh dissolves he takes away with him the misfortunes of his devotees.
I was lucky one morning to be out when this procession of three tractors, each with their own large Ganesh and many smaller ones passed me by. A group of men led the way, playing drums, singing and dancing. Children sat on the back of the tractor, laughing having a lot of fun.
I've learned a couple important terms during this celebration. The temporary tent temples that I described in the last post are called Pandals. Puja is a sacred ritual that Hindu people perform, to pray and adore their deities.
The stalls selling the Ganesh statues have disappeared and the Pandals stand empty, all signs that the celebration is coming to an end...until next year that is.
