 Night of the Living Delay

It's almost done. Really. A few more chapters and some serious editing and Night of the Living Celery, a veggie-chilling murder mystery, will be ready for consumption. It's nearing its climax now, but chapter one won't be posted on the 13th as I had hoped. I won't make any more release date predictions, but it shouldn't be long.

"I’m two blocks east of your location," came the reply. "Hazel and Filbert. I followed the smell. Onions really stink when they’re sweating."

That's all for now. Happy waiting!
