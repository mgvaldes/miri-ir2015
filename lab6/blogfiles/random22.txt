 Merry Freaking Christmas

I am pretty sure this will be my last chance to blog until after Christmas.

I hope you all have a very wonderful holiday....dont drink or eat too much. Enjoy your family and your friends.

I am missing my dad. Wishing he was here. Feeling overwhelmed by everything, but I stress pretty easily, especially this time of year.

Here is hoping that everyone is happy, healthy and well loved. I know that I am so hoping for CG to straighten out so we can still have a good Christmas together.

I think if CG and I do get together, I am going to subject him to watching "The Santa Claus" with Tim Allen...I LOVE that movie. After that one is over, then he will be forced to watch "The Santa Claus 2: The Mrs. Claus". He should be good and bored by then! That's what he gets for stressing me out on a holiday weekend. The bastard.

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night! hehe.
