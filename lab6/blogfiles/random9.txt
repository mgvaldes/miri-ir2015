Tis' a good day to make spaghetti. 
Ugh. Dreary day. Been raining for most of the day, and it's supposed to rain even more over the next few days. Hopefully will get to spend time with James tonight, as I think it's pretty unlikely his softball game will happen. 
Have been pretty unmotivated all weekend. Didn't even make it out to socialize and what not last night. (I KNOW! No worries, I'm not sick. lol) 
Discovered Batman is trying to hook up with a good friend of mine, which I don't think it bothers me at all, but...it's just...weird. It's like watching a brother hit on your best friend. Even though Elyse and I aren't as close as we could be. It's still weirdish. Hmm.
It's a good spaghetti day. I always liek to make spaghetti when I'm feeling lowered. Because It involves alot of pots and dishes...semi messy. And it looks complicated, when it really isn't. Make me feel as if I've accomplished at least something during a dreary day. Think I'll have company over. 
Or go feed my Sims obsession. Anyone know how to get a kid to actually cast the "Make Cakes" charm correctly? All I ever get is a house full of frogs. Or a yard full.
