 Steady - Weigh In #6

I was worried all week about the kind of number that I was going to bring in at the scale because I was eating out AND because I ate all of my 35 extra points. I typically don't do that. The reason I did is because when I looked back at my tracker at the weeks when I had the most weight loss I had eaten more of the extra points. The strategy worked, along with drinking two big mugs of green tea a day.

The numbers:
Starting weight - 224.4
Week one - 1
Week two - 4.6
Week three - 3.2
Week four - 3.4
Week five - 1.2
WEEK SIX - 2.8

Total weight loss - 16.2 lbs
Current weight - 208.2

Some of you may remember that I actually begin this journey in May of 2006. When I stopped in June (mainly because I was bored and I didn't want to worry about what I was eating anymore) I had lost 18.6.

On May 11th 2006 I weighed 246.2....WOW. So in total I have lost 38 pounds! My clothes are so loose I can hardly wear them any more. I just bought a new pair of pants this weekend...its so exciting.
