Day Dreaming
I constantly find myself day dreaming....I think about everything from what belongings I am going to be able to fit into my car to what it is going to be like to live all by myself for the first time.

I think the hardest part about this move is going to be missing mom and dad. I have gotten so used to having them close by these last 3 years after college that I am trying to prepare myself to be homesick for awhile. Mom and Dad are just going to have to come visit me....and visit me often!

I am so ready for this challenge. I am SOOO ready for a new job! I know its going to be a lot of work to find something but I will make it work....I have to....
