Remember a few months back I posted about The Boy's pending visit to the orthodontist?

First - we were mistaken. He has two more teeth to loose.

Regardless, the orthodontist has decided to move forward with braces. In April, The Boy will have a palate expander put in (we have to wait that long until those adult teeth grow in to hook the palate expander to). After that, he'll have the braces installed.

He's not happy. He wants invisible braces. We haven't even discussed that the whole process can be painful, or that he won't be able to eat certain foods...

Talking to other parents, this is apparently the age for mouth improvement. It seems like every third child is having SOMETHING done in his or her mouth. So The Boy won't be alone in his misery.

When I was his age, my mouth was a mess, but my family couldn't afford braces.

We have been so blessed not to have to worry about money to cover medical and dental bills. The military, while we're overseas, will cover the full cost of The Boy's orthodontic work.

Isn't it amazing how He does that? Brings us to a place at the perfect time, letting us be free of worry!
