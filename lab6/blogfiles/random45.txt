I've been feeling solemn lately. thoughtful. quiet.
lots of hmmmm... moments.
I went to an assembly tonight. Remembering Rachel Scott...a victim of the Columbine school shootings. Wow. What a wonderful young lady. She really knew what she wanted out of her short life. Please learn more about her. Decide to join her challenge. Rachel's Challenge. A chain reaction of kindness!
To top that off...I've been lurking through blogs lately. Blogs of people I don't know. Tragedy has struck their homes, lives, existence! Yet, God has prevailed. If you want to read, pray, put things into perspective....click on a one of these links 1, 2, or 3 to name a short few. It has really helped me learn to not take one moment for granted.
I feel mellower (is that a word)...the little things don't make me snap. Just enjoy them! We lay on the couch and giggle and read stories at night, go caterpillar hunting, make pictures, etc.
Tonight, Colby's puppy died. It was so sad. He cried and cried and cried. We had only gotten him on Saturday, so we were only getting to know him. I have a few pics but they are on my computer at work. He was so proud of HIS puppy. How did I make him giggle tonight? I let Kodiak in the house, but shhhh...don't tell Vance! It was lots of fun to run and run around the house watching Kodiak slip and slide. And then I let him sleep in our bed, b/c that's always the best place to sleep right?
Sweet dreams, friends. I hope that you go home and love on your special people tonight!

p.s. after rereading this post, i'm not sure it makes sense. sorry....i'll try to do better tomorrow!
