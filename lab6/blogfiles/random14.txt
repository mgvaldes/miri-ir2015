Rumors Available Again
The Theoretical Particle Physics Jobs Rumor Mill has a new home. It’s no longer at the University of Washington, now it’s at the College of William and Mary Physics department.
Now that it’s available again, the Rumor Mill has the striking news that Harvard has chosen for a faculty position one of its postdocs: Lubos Motl. Lubos is well-known as undoubtedly the most rabidly fanatic string theorist around, always willing to heap abuse and scorn on anyone who questions the idea that string theory is the language in which God wrote the world. Unlike many string theorists though, he actually knows what is going on in the field and is someone who can give you an accurate view of exactly what the state of the theory is (all you have to do is strip out his ravings about how string theory is unique and the source of all good ideas in physics and mathematics). He’s also not foolish enough to swallow the “Anthropic” nonsense that is becoming ever more prevalent among string theorists, and it’s a been a bit scary recently to see him acting as the voice of reason in the subject.
