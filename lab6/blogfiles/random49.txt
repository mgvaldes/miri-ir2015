From a Turkish Balcony Garden
Earlier in the spring I planted some herbs, lettuce, and tomatoes on two of our three balconies and flowers on the third.  Though it hasn't been the harvest I dreamed about, I have had some mild success.  Last weekend while my husband was away I decided to treat myself to Turkish breakfast to help me miss him less (yes I admit to having an unhelpful habit of using food for comfort).

What is Turkish breakfast? It is bread, cheese, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, parsley (or other green herbs), butter, jam, eggs, and tea just as a start. It typically begins late, is best served on a balcony, eaten with friends and/or a newspaper, lasts over two hours and often ends with a nap. OK, obviously I'm exaggerating on some of those points, but I want to paint a vivid picture.

In my Turkish-breakfast-for-one-to-miss-my-husband-less breakfast, I decided to gather a few things from my balcony garden. You can see the handful of cherry tomatoes and purslane I picked in these photos.


The tomatoes are likely familiar though they are orange-colored. The purslane I discovered after I moved to Turkey and it's something I've grown to love both served cold as a salad or warm as a main dish made with ground beef. When the stalks come up thin like this, I love to munch on them raw with breakfast.




I have some video I took in the spring when I just started my garden but it's my first attempt at video and I haven't yet decided if I want to share it - it's pretty clumsy. Anyway, while I have a think about that I send my hopes that one day we'll be able to share Turkish breakfast together with treats from my garden, either balcony or terrestrial, in Turkey or the States. 
Knowing What You Want To Do
My dad often says, "It's great to be alive today." Specifically he is referring to advances in technology and the amazing ways they allow us to do things and connect with each other. As an American in Turkey living far away from my family and my culture, Information Technology is my lifeline. There are so many opportunities online and there is so much to do and discover. And there are so many interesting people to meet. One of those people is Michelle Ward.


Several months ago I took a blogging course called Blogging Your Way offered by Holly Becker of Decor8. It was a great program and I came out of it with some good ideas and some new friends and contacts. Michelle was in that course and now that I know her, I wish I'd met her years ago.

Michelle is a creative career coach and walks alongside people who are either trying to figure out what they want to be when they "grow up" or how to include their creative passions into careers they're already living. She is in her own words "their springboard, their partner, their confidante, their cheerleader."

You may recall in a post I wrote awhile back, I talked about the fact that a big part of being an expat is struggling with identity and figuring out who you are. And I struggled. But when I say I wish I had met Michelle sooner, I mean that as a life coach she would have been there walking alongside me to help me discover my path in a much more supportive and constructive way. (And I'm sure there would have been a lot less tears!)

A big part of coaching is working with people to see themselves more clearly and help them define their own direction. As a life coach, Michelle:

* effectively listens
* reserves judgement
* offers feedback (not advice or criticism)
* asks questions that help you uncover the answers that best suit you
* is supportive and enthusiastic
* keeps you focused on your goals
* acknowledges your actions and hard work
* challenges you to change your behavior
* brainstorms with you to uncover new solutions
* offers tools to increase your self-discovery
* assists you with putting your goals into action
* holds you accountable for your efforts

So if you were considering my advice to do something that makes you uncomfortable in order to know yourself better, I would like to recommend something much less painful - get in touch with Michelle and let her work with you to figure out what you want to be "when you grow up".
