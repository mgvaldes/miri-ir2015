Reading A Layout Part 4
This is part 4 and the final blog post on how to read a layout. When we go into an apartment to measure a kitchen, we take all measurements, this way if we change a layout, and decide to put an appliance on a wall that we initially did not think we would when we first measured. we would have all wall sizes. When measuring, we measure "everything"(like we mentioned earlier here), that includes all pipes, electrical outlets, switches, phone jacks, door bells, and anything else you will come across in the kitchens(there are others that are pretty common in NYC apartment buildings that I hope to go into in the near future.
On the layout you will see a list of owner notes, as well as a list of Installer notes(notes are pretty much self explanatory).

When we list the owner notes, those are items that the property manager/contractor would have to take care of, before the kitchen is installed. The Installer notes, are items that need to get done by the installer, weather it`s Regal Kitchens doing the installation, or the customer doing it on their own. You the customer will now have all instructions sitting on your desk without even having to go to the job site, you know exactly what has to get done, and can properly manage it from the comfort of your office chair.
