Remember here where I said my husband and I don't really do holidays like Valentine's Day?

I guess it wasn't totally true.

What we have a tendency to do is buy gifts around that time, then label it as our gift for that holiday.

This week was a prime example. We decided to break down and buy a GPS for traveling. Heck, just to get around to some of our friends houses!

Sometimes, Mapquest just doesn't get us to where we want to go - umm, like the exact house. Often, we're on the cell phone, driving up and down the street, trying to figure out just what are friends were talking about when they gave us detailed directions to their front doors. If someone says it'll take 15 minutes to get somewhere, we give ourselves 30 until we've been there at least once.

Back to the point - we decided to buy a GPS and title it our "family Valentine's present."

We looked at everything available to us at our store on post - several times. We talked to people. We discussed which options were important to us. We finally settled on which one met our needs.

And discovered it was out of stock. They'll call us when it comes in. Keep in mind, we've been waiting six weeks for ink for our printer... the printer they featured, we bought, and haven't seen ink for since.

I guess we'll have to get to our destination in Germany the old-fashioned way, by map. With some cell-phone assistance thrown in for good measure.
