Whither to Post, Tweet or Facebook?

On the blog we have a straightforward post policy, Bill and I try to make one post on nearly every work day. Occasionally we'll have extra posts for breaking news, mostly deaths and truly major new theorems. But occasionally we'd have short announcements or pointers. Sometimes we would pad a short item with an extra observation or I would sometimes just have a post with a long list of short items.

Right after STOC I started experimenting with Twitter and quickly got hooked. With no fixed schedule I can give quick tweets on anything that interests me or I think important for the community to know. Sometimes I can get what would have been a post down under Twitter's 140 character limit. So now I use the blog for longer posts and tweet the shorter stuff, using Twitter as an extension to the blog. 

Sounds ideal but there's a catch. Only a small fraction of you blog readers also follow me on Twitter. Some of what I Tweet would have been in the blog. So sometimes I need to repeat a tweet as a longer post or occasionally post a list of the more important and/or interesting tweets. What an excuse to do that now.

    * Tron returns and NYT worries about computers taking over. Coincidence?

    * And from June 3rd: Taught Moser's proof in my intro theory course today! (A comment worthy to be my first twitter post).


Maybe I can talk Bill into Tweeting too. Imagine non-stop van der Waerden numbers. 

Now what about Facebook? In Facebook I can break my friends into roughly three groups.

   1. Academics
   2. Friends and Family
   3. People I haven't seen in 25 years.


Problem is I have little to say to all three groups so I don't change my Facebook status often. Basically a few status updates about where I am traveling or some photos of the family. Facebook allows you to create groups of friends and show updates only within those groups. I need the opposite operation, creating status updates that only go out to a select group or groups. I'll likely use Facebook for my personal stuff, if you are in groups 1 or 3 and hide or unfriend me I won't be insulted.
